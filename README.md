This is a project for creating a Power BI Map visual of world's powerplants.
The dataset used is an open source dataset from Wolrd Resource Institute. More info in the "Dataset info" folder.

The data was imported to a Postgres database through direct command prompt commands and then pulled to Power BI from the DB.
